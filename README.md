# Pull Request Checkstyle

Pull Request Checkstyle is a simple Github action which helps to set up some styling rules for pull requests `commit message` and `branch name`
and identify their violation during CI runtime.

# Contribution rules:
1. Make sure there is a GitHub issue describing the changes you want to contribute with. (Add one if needed)
2. Submit a PR just in case you:
  - Fixed the bug or implement the new feature properly;
  - Covered all code with unit tests;
  - Updated the changelog file;
  - Updated the documentation (If needed);
